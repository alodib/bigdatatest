I need to check if there is any files than can be improved

```python
# Python Program to calculate the square root

# Note: change this value for a different result
num = 8 

# uncomment to take the input from the user
#num = float(input('Enter a number: '))
num_sqrt = num ** 0.5
print('The square root of %0.3f is %0.3f'%(num ,num_sqrt))
```
